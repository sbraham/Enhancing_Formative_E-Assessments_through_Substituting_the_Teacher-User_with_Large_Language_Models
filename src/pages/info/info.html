        <h4>What is FormAtiveQuIz?</h4>

        <p>
            We, at the FormAtiveQuIz Team, understand the importance of educating our users about what our application
            is
            and, notably, what is isn’t. Artificial Intelligence is a complicated field with many misconceptions and
            we want to use to page to detail what it is good for you to know.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our system create questions using a pre-trained general purpose Large Lanauge Model (LLM), similar to
            products like ChatGPT. These models are trained on large amount of textual data collected of the
            internet. They then find patterns in these data, most notably the probability that a word follows
            another word in a sentence. <br>
            <br>
            If the LLM were to be given the sentence, <br>
            <em>“The first colour in a rainbow is ”</em> <br>
            Might out put <em></em>“red”</em>. This output can be added onto the end of the sentence, and the process
            can repeat
            to produce whole new sentences and paragraphs. <br>
            <br>
            <em>“The first colour in a rainbow is red. The second colour in a rainbow is orange. The third colour in a
                rainbow is yellow.”</em> <br>
            <br>
            From this we can understand that, despite the complicated algorithms, the LLM is generating questions
            through finding probabilistic patterns in existing text.<br>
            <br>
            This constroles randomness is why the same prompt can produce multiple different question, and also why
            sometimes the prompts may be unusual. We work hard to ensure the best questlity questions regenerated
            every time, but something this doesn’t work.

        <h6>Things to keep in mind.</h6>

        <p>
            The program doesn’t understand the topics it creates questions one so there is always a chance it gets
            topics wrong.<br>
            <br>
            The system is “pre-trained” so none of the prompts you give us are used to train the model permanently,
            although the models prompts do benefit from the information you give it. Note that the prompts are
            stored on our database and so personal data should not be used in them.<br>
            <br>
            The information you give in the description of the prompts makes it more likely for outputs to be
            generated with that specific topic in mind. The more you give it on a topic, the more questions it will
            generate about that topic.
