###### Running LLM API
Currently, the LLM API runs locally.
To get the same result as I have with your local device,
1) Install LM-Studio - https://lmstudio.ai/
2) Search for TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF and Download mistral-7b-openorca.Q5_K_M.gguf
3) Start the local inference server (making sure it's running at localhost:1234)
4) Then do any action on the web-app which requires the LLM integration
