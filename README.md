Title: "Using Large Language Models to Enhance Computer-aided Assessment"

Project Category/Topic: 
 - Education Technology
 - Learning Management System
 - Computer-Aided Formative Assessment
 - Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models

Project Aim:
The aim is to develop a website application that enhances existing Computer-Aided Formative Assessment (CAFA) technology using Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on students. Using a user-specified title and an optional text block as prompts, as well as a prompt-engineered or finetuned structure, I will automate the high-quality generation and marking of quizzes, especially long answer questions; as well as this, tailored support for students through questions and dynamic matching of questions to students will ensure engagement and improvement. This is important as, although existing solutions have integrated LLMs, most only use this technology to write questions for teacher-created quizzes. I aim to focus entirely on the student. Removing the need for a human to create the quiz drastically streamlines the process for a student taking formative assessment.
